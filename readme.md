LPC1114-Blink
=============

This code (as configured) blinks an LED on GPIO1_8 at a rate of 1Hz.

This code includes a linker script for the LPC1114FN28/102 chip, and is modified to run off the internal RC oscillator.

This code works well with the toolchain found here: http://www.meatandnetworking.com/tutorials/arm-cortex-mx-quickstart/
